// npm workspaces are a feature of npm that allows you to manage multiple packages within a single top-level, root package.
// This is useful when you have multiple packages that depend on each other.

// have to add tsconfig to root
// then use extends in the tsconfig of the client and server

// however client and server may have different versions for their dependencies
// so it needs to be troubleshooted if there are any issues
